# MFA Widget: Internationalization

You can customize mfa widget language by feeding the widget with your own language-specific dictionary items using the `languageDictionary` option. This is also useful if you want to keep English the language, but change the specific wording of a few items, such as re-wording the `title` or making various other labels read different messages, but leaving the remaining text on the widget intact.

The `languageDictionary` option have to be added to the mfa api widget configuration into the Guardian Hosted Page.

```js
// Customize some languageDictionary attributes
var languageDictionary = {
  defaults: {
    title: 'MFA Login',
    rememberBrowserCheckbox: 'Remember me'
  },

  // ...
};

// Initiating our MFAWidget
var lock = new Auth0MFAWidget({
  container: "container",

  // ... all properties as set in the hosted page

  languageDictionary: languageDictionary
});
```

If you want to use this to fully customize the widget language you have to replace all language properties
by the values appropriate to the language you want to translate to.

::: note
See the [English dictionary file for MFA Widget](/mfa-widget-language-file) for an example of available `languageDictionary` property names, and of how to structure a `language` file.
